            <br>
            We are here because if enough code review was performed we would be finding horrible code in the wild.

            I cannot emphasize enough how great is code review for this task.

            By the time code review was introduced on my team I was still fresh.

            At first a was a bit grumpy but soon I started to love it.

            They want to code, and you force them to think about code.
            <br>
            You get them out of the attitude "It works"
            <br />
            But if you reviews others is more likely that they will review you.
            <br />
            Because the review procces blocks them.
